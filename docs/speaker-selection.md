# Speaker Selection

Choosing the right voice for your Text-to-Speech (TTS) application is crucial for creating an engaging user experience. Dubverse offers a diverse range of high-quality voices across multiple languages and accents. This guide will help you navigate our speaker options and select the perfect voice for your project.

## Exploring the Speaker Playground

Our Speaker Playground is a powerful tool designed to help you audition and select the ideal voice for your TTS needs.

### Accessing the Speaker Playground

1. Log in to your Dubverse account at [https://webapp.dubverse.ai/](https://webapp.dubverse.ai/){:target="\_blank"}
2. Navigate to the "TTS API" page in the main menu
3. Click on the "Speakers" tab

### Features of the Speaker Playground

- **Language Filtering**: Easily filter voices by language or dialect
- **Gender Selection**: Choose between male, female, and neutral voice options
- **Audio Sampling**: Listen to high-quality audio samples for each voice
- **Speaker Details**: View comprehensive information about each voice, including:
  - Speaker Number (for API calls)
  - Language

## Implementing Speakers in Your API Calls

Once you've chosen a speaker, use its Number in your API requests:

```json
{
  "text": "Welcome to Dubverse TTS! How can I assist you today?",
  "speaker_no": 181
}
```

In this example, `181` represents the chosen speaker's Number.

## Best Practices for Speaker Selection

1. **Know Your Audience**: Choose a voice that resonates with your target demographic in terms of language, accent, and style.

2. **Consider Context**: Select a voice appropriate for your application's purpose (e.g., a professional tone for business applications, a friendly voice for customer service bots).

3. **Test Thoroughly**: Use the Speaker Playground to test your specific content with multiple voices before making a final decision.

4. **Consistency is Key**: Stick to one voice per character or purpose in your application to maintain a coherent user experience.

5. **Stay Updated**: Regularly check the Speaker Playground for new voices that might better suit your needs.

6. **Localization**: For global applications, consider using region-specific accents to enhance user engagement and authenticity.
